🌟 Usage

Start Chatting:

Type your message in the chat input box at the bottom of the page.
The chatbot responds with tailored advice, leveraging the urban farming knowledge base.


Upload an Image:

Use the sidebar to upload an image (e.g., a photo of your terrace).
The chatbot will process the image alongside your text query to provide context-aware responses.
The uploaded image is displayed in the sidebar and cleared after processing to avoid reuse.


View Chat History:

Previous messages and images are displayed in the main chat area for easy reference.


Urban Farming Tips:

Ask about plants, containers, or soil suitable for your terrace.
The chatbot uses predefined instructions and the knowledge file to provide actionable advice.




🎨 Example Interaction
User: Uploads a terrace image"I want to start an urban farm on this terrace. What plants should I grow?"
Chatbot:"This is a fantastic space for an urban farm! Based on the image, I see a terrace with great potential for plants that need a lot of sunlight. I recommend sun-loving vegetables like tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants, as well as herbs like rosemary, basil, and mint. Ensure your containers have good drainage and use a lightweight potting mix. Would you like specific care tips for any of these plants?"

🔧 Customization

Change Model Parameters: Modify WATSONX_MODEL_PARAMETERS in app.py to adjust temperature, max_new_tokens, etc., for different response styles.
Update Knowledge Base: Edit urban_terrace_farming_knowledge.txt to include new information or adapt for other domains.
Switch Models: Update WATSONX_MODEL_ID to use other vision-enabled models available in your Watsonx.ai instance.


🐛 Troubleshooting

API Errors: Verify your WATSONX_API_KEY, WATSONX_PROJECT_ID, and WATSONX_SERVICE_URL are correct.
Model Issues: Ensure the selected model supports multimodal (text + image) input.
Image Upload Errors: Check that uploaded images are in PNG, JPG, or JPEG format and are not corrupted.
Knowledge File Missing: Ensure urban_terrace_farming_knowledge.txt exists in the project directory.

For further assistance, refer to the Watsonx.ai Documentation or contact IBM Cloud support.

🌍 Future Enhancements

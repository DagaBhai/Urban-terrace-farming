## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Update `app.py` with your Watsonx.ai credentials:
   - `WATSONX_API_KEY`: Your IBM Cloud API key.
   - `WATSONX_PROJECT_ID`: Your Watsonx.ai project ID.
   - `WATSONX_SERVICE_URL`: Your Watsonx.ai service URL (e.g., `https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com`).
   - `WATSONX_MODEL_ID`: Choose a vision-enabled model (e.g., `meta-llama/llama-3-2-90b-vision-instruct`).

3. **Prepare Knowledge File**:
   Ensure `urban_terrace_farming_knowledge.txt` is in the project directory with relevant information for the chatbot.

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash

## üåü Usage

1. **Start Chatting**:
   - Type your message in the chat input box at the bottom of the page.
   - The chatbot responds with tailored advice, leveraging the urban farming knowledge base.

2. **Upload an Image**:
   - Use the sidebar to upload an image (e.g., a photo of your terrace).
   - The chatbot will process the image alongside your text query to provide context-aware responses.
   - The uploaded image is displayed in the sidebar and cleared after processing to avoid reuse.

3. **View Chat History**:
   - Previous messages and images are displayed in the main chat area for easy reference.

4. **Urban Farming Tips**:
   - Ask about plants, containers, or soil suitable for your terrace.
   - The chatbot uses predefined instructions and the knowledge file to provide actionable advice.

## üé® Example Interaction

**User**: *Uploads a terrace image*  
"I want to start an urban farm on this terrace. What plants should I grow?"

**Chatbot**:  
"This is a fantastic space for an urban farm! Based on the image, I see a terrace with great potential for plants that need a lot of sunlight. I recommend sun-loving vegetables like tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants, as well as herbs like rosemary, basil, and mint. Ensure your containers have good drainage and use a lightweight potting mix. Would you like specific care tips for any of these plants?"

## üîß Customization

- **Change Model Parameters**: Modify `WATSONX_MODEL_PARAMETERS` in `app.py` to adjust `temperature`, `max_new_tokens`, etc., for different response styles.
- **Update Knowledge Base**: Edit `urban_terrace_farming_knowledge.txt` to include new information or adapt for other domains.
- **Switch Models**: Update `WATSONX_MODEL_ID` to use other vision-enabled models available in your Watsonx.ai instance.

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- **API Errors**: Verify your `WATSONX_API_KEY`, `WATSONX_PROJECT_ID`, and `WATSONX_SERVICE_URL` are correct.
- **Model Issues**: Ensure the selected model supports multimodal (text + image) input.
- **Image Upload Errors**: Check that uploaded images are in PNG, JPG, or JPEG format and are not corrupted.
- **Knowledge File Missing**: Ensure `urban_terrace_farming_knowledge.txt` exists in the project directory.

For further assistance, refer to the [Watsonx.ai Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx) or contact IBM Cloud support.
